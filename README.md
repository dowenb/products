# Community Fake Product Catalog

Products is a Community Project, with the intention of building a shared pool of fake products that can be used to aid learn.

It is intended that each fake product will have sufficiently rich detail to allow them to be used for multiple scenarios. Each product will be documented with meta data to describe what learning it is designed to support. For example one fake product might be suitable for learning how to build automated checks, and also support exploratory testing. While other Products might only contain enough to practice some business analysis techniques, and others might be helpful to guide writing an implementation in code.

Not all fake products will have coded implementations, and some maybe have multiple. All examples will remain open to being updated, and should have some utility when only partially complete.

## Contribute

I am actively seeking open source contributions form the community! This could include:

* Adding detail to the requirements, back story or other written parts of an existing product
* Fixing unintentional mistakes (some mistakes are intentional to aid learning how about testing!)
* Adding exercises, challenges or other rich supporting material to existing products
* Writhing or updating documentation
* Creating your own new fake product
* Creating a code implementation of a product, for others to freely use
* Promoting the project and getting others involved
* Supporting other volunteers to contribute
